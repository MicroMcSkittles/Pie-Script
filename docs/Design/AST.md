[Back](../../README.md)

The abstract syntax tree consists of nodes that can have child nodes the most important of these nodes is the *program node*. The program node stores a list of statement nodesthat can be run buy the interpreter.

## Implementation
The AST nodes will be implemented with a programming technique called [Object Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). The diagram bellow shows the structure of the AST nodes.
