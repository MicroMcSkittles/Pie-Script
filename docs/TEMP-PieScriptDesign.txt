Expressions ============================================================

    Expressions represent values.

    Numeric
        Supported symbols
            + Add
            - Subtract
            * Multiply
            / Divide
            & And
            | Or
            % Modulus
            ^ Exponent 
            ! Factorial

        These operations can only be used with numeric values. Most operations require two numbers except
        for the factorial and subtract operations. The subtract operation can be placed behind a numeric
        value to show that it's negative or used to subtract to numbers. The factorial operation can be 
        placed after a numaric value to find it's factorial.

    Boolean
        Supported symbols
            && And
            || Or
            == Equal
            != Not Equal
            >= Grater than or Equal
            <= Less than or Equal

        All of these operations require two values to functions. Boolean operations can use both boolean 
        values and numaric values. Boolean operations only return boolean values. If a numaric value is compaired
        to a boolean value with a boolean operation then the numaric value will be converted to a boolean value 
        based on if the numaric value is grater than zero. Ex: 0 = false, 3 = true, 10 = true

    String
        Supported symbols
            + Add

        A string needs to be the left value to use the add operation. Adding a string to a string combines
        the strings into one new string. Adding a number to the string puts the number on the end of the 
        string. Adding a boolean to the string puts ether true or false of the end of the string based
        on the boolean.

Variables ==============================================================

    Variables are used to store values. They can be defined in three ways

    var _NAME_ = _EXPRESSION_   Stores value into variable, automaticly detects type.
    var _NAME_                  Creates empty variable with no type. Can't be used until set with expression.
    var _NAME_ : _TYPE_         Creates empty variable with a type. Can't be used until set with expression of specified type.
